Currently I am reading the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". I am uploading here the excercises I finished, feel free to look.

The book is available here https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/6515.pdf

The programming language is called "Scheme", which comes from another language called "Lisp". The installation of Scheme is here: https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/
